                           License Manager Plugins
================================================================================

Todo list
---------

Global:
    - Rewrite README.

Flexlm:
    - Add thresholds for expiration date of features (thresholds in days when to trigger WARNING and CRITICAL)
    - Write plugin "check_flexlm_feature_lock": check if a license for a feature is issued for a long time.
        - Check if a feature is issued for too much time (thresholds in days availables).
    - Create a PNP template for license usage.
        - Create a graph per DS.
