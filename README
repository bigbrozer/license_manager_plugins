Requirements
------------

Note:

FlexLM:

You need to install "lmutil" utility on your Nagios server in order to use the plugin:

Once you downloaded the file, copy content in a directory.

LSTC:

TODO: write LSTC requirements.

Get the plugin package
----------------------

Note:
  I recommend installing 'git' on your Nagios server in order to download and keep up to date this plugin.
  If you are behind a proxy, you can export http_proxy environment variable before.

Go inside your Nagios plugins directory (usually /usr/local/nagios/libexec), then type in:

  git clone git://github.com/bigbrozer/license_manager_plugins.git

This will create a new folder "license_manager_plugins".

Configuration
-------------

Edit the file "config.py" and set *_PATH variables to the correct location for each license tools on your system.

Note:
  You do not need to configure all, only the one you will use !
