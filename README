Once you downloaded the file, copy content in a directory.

Get the plugin package
----------------------

Note:
  I recommend installing 'git' on your Nagios server in order to download and keep up to date this plugin.
  If you are behind a proxy, you can export http_proxy environment variable before.

Go inside your Nagios plugins directory (usually /usr/local/nagios/libexec), then type in:

  git clone git://github.com/bigbrozer/flexlm_nagios_plugins.git

This will create a new folder "flexlm_nagios_plugins" with the plugin data inside.

Configuration
-------------

Edit the file "config.py" and set LMUTIL_PATH variable to the location of lmutil on your system.

  LMUTIL_PATH = "/path/to/lmutil"

Usage
=====

Usage: check_flexlm_status.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help  show help message and exit
  -l LICENSE  FLEXlm port or license file to check

Example:

  check_flexlm_status.py -l 2700@my_license_server
