Installation
============

Requirements
------------

Note:
  You do not need to install all license utility, only the one you will use !

*LM-X:*

You need to get from the support page on X-Formation website the 'lmxendutil' utility. Copy it in your PATH or wherever you want.
Then configure the plugin, see below.

*FlexLM:*

You need to install "lmutil" utility on your Nagios server in order to use the plugin:
http://www.globes.com/support/fnp_utilities_download.htm

Once you downloaded the file, copy content in a directory.

*LSTC:*

- Need command "lstc_qrun".
- TODO: write LSTC requirements.

*LUM:*

- Need commands "i4tv" and "i4blt".
- TODO: write LUM requirements.

Get the plugin package
----------------------

Note:
  I recommend installing 'git' on your Nagios server in order to download and keep up to date this plugin.
  If you are behind a proxy, you can export http_proxy environment variable before.

Go inside your Nagios plugins directory (usually /usr/local/nagios/libexec), then type in::

  git clone git://github.com/bigbrozer/license_manager_plugins.git

This will create a new folder "license_manager_plugins".

Configuration
-------------

Edit the file "config.py" and set *_PATH variables to the correct location for each license tools on your system.

Note:
  You do not need to configure all, only the one you will use !

Specials for LUM plugins
------------------------

If you will use plugin "check_lum_license_expiration.pl", you must get the file "i4rpt.fmt" from your LUM installation and copy it "/opt/lum". It also assumes that you have both commands "i4tv" and "i4blt" in your PATH.

This is a old script I did quickly in the past (written in Perl). It will do the job, but I will rewrite it using Python like the others.

Usage
=====

See help by typing::

  plugin.py|pl -h
